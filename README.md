*Introduction*

The RC /15 F1 Light Set uses a small microcontroller to listen to the throttle signal from the receiver in an RC car and control LEDs. The integrated y-cable adapter goes between the receiver and the electronic speed controller (ESC).
There are three (3) JST SH sockets on the F1 Control Module that are all controlled together. You can use all three or any combination you choose.
Instructions
1.	For ease of wiring, unplug the 3 lights from the module (if they arrived attached).
2.	Unplug the ESC from the receiver.
3.	Plug the y-cable adapter into the throttle channel of the receiver and the ESC into the open socket of the adapter
4.	Attach the LED modules (the rear panel and two vertical wing lights) to appropriate places on the chassis or body work
5.	Plug your desired combination of lights into the module

*Operation*
•	Always turn the transmitter on before turning on the car/receiver
•	The control module will detect neutral during start-up, so calibration is not required. Also, make sure that you leave the transmitter in neutral until the lights come on.
Notes
•	The control module has a combined maximum output capacity of 160mA. If you wish to add your own lights or devices please keep this in mind.
•	If your radio & receiver support it, the throttle signal can be mirrored/mixed to a spare channel and you can plug the control module into this port. In this case, leave the ESC plugged into channel 2, and the Y-socket output is not used.
Changing the throttle direction
•	This version of the control board supports reversing the throttle direction. As shipped, the unit recognises the normal throttle direction of most Sanwa/Airtronic/FlySky radios. This is the same as "REV" on most Futaba radios. Most modern ESC's default to this orientation, so it is recommended. However, if your radio configuration cannot be adjusted, then follow the next step
•	Using a fine-tipped soldering iron, place a dab of solder on the pad on the underside of the board. Removing the solder will return lights to full brightness. See picture:

Dimming
•	This version of the control board (HV07) supports dimming for night time or indoor use
